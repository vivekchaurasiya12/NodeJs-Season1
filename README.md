### Episode 1 - Introduction to Node.js

What is Node.js?

Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Node.js is single-threaded, event-driven, and non-blocking.

It is used for building fast, scalable network applications.

Node.js executes JavaScript code outside the browser.

---

### Episode 2 - How Node.js Works Behind the Scenes

Node.js architecture explained: Event Loop, Event Queue, Thread Pool.

libuv library handles asynchronous tasks.

Node.js manages thousands of operations without creating thousands of threads.

Importance of non-blocking behavior for scalability.

---

### Episode 3 - Installing Node.js and Writing First Program

Installed Node.js and npm.

Wrote and ran the first Node.js program using the command `node filename.js`.

Node.js allows running JavaScript directly in the system environment, outside the browser.

---

### Episode 4 - Call Stack, Event Loop, Task Queue

What is a Call Stack and how JavaScript manages function calls.

Introduction to Event Loop and how it works with async tasks.

Task Queue (also known as Callback Queue) and its role.

Difference between Browser Event Loop and Node.js Event Loop.

---

### Episode 5 - Blocking vs Non-Blocking Code

Blocking code waits and stops the execution of the next code.

Non-blocking code uses callbacks and does not block the flow.

Node.js is designed to favor non-blocking (asynchronous) operations.

Benefits of using asynchronous programming in high-performance servers.

---

### Episode 6 - How Node.js Handles Async Operations Internally

Detailed working of libuv and its role.

Thread Pool usage for heavy asynchronous operations (e.g., file system operations).

Different phases of the Event Loop (Timers, Pending Callbacks, Poll, Check, Close Callbacks).

Understanding how Node.js achieves concurrency using a single thread with background threads.
