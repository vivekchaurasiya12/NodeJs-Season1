# 🌟 Namaste Node.js Journey - My Learnings 🚀

---

## 🚀 Episode 1: The Origin Story

- 🛠️ Node.js launched in **2009** by Ryan Dahl.
- 🌐 JavaScript was originally browser-only — now runs on **servers** too!
- ⚡ Non-blocking, asynchronous I/O = **super fast** performance.
- 🔧 Powered by **V8 engine** (Chrome’s JavaScript engine).
- 😵 Early challenges: **Callback Hell**, heavy CPU loads.
- 🧵 Despite being single-threaded, Node.js handles **multiple requests** efficiently. 

---

## 🖥️ Episode 2: JavaScript on Server

- 🖥️ **Server** = just a remote CPU.
- 🛠️ Node.js = C++ application + embedded V8 engine.
- 🔄 Flow: **JavaScript → V8 → Machine Code → Binary**.
- 📜 **ECMAScript** = JavaScript rulebook 📖.
- 🧠 From high-level code to binary = *brain melt moment* 🤯.

---

## 🌍 Episode 3: Global Objects

- 🧠 **Global Object** provides global functions and variables.
- 🔸 In browsers: `window`, `this`, `self`.
- 🔹 In Node.js: `global`.
- ✅ **`globalThis`** works for both browser and Node.js environments!
- 📜 Fun Quiz:  
  ```javascript
  console.log(globalThis === window); // true in browser
  ```

---

## 📦 Episode 4: CJM vs ESM

- 🔹 **CommonJS Modules (CJM)** → `require()` and `module.exports`.
- 🔹 **ECMAScript Modules (ESM)** → `import` and `export`.
- 💬 Learned when to use each based on project needs.
- 🧩 Modular coding = cleaner, more maintainable apps!

---

## 🧠 Episode 5: Modules & IIFE

- 🛡️ Every Node.js module is wrapped inside an **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**.
- ✔️ Keeps variables **private** and avoids polluting the global scope.
- 🧠 **Caching**: Once a module is loaded, it’s cached for reuse, boosting performance!

## 🕶️ Episode 6: The Secret Agent - LiBUV!

🌟 Today I bumped into a hidden superhero: **𝗟𝗶𝗕𝗨𝗩** – *The Secret Agent of Node.js!* 🦸‍♂️

Until today, I thought JavaScript was that obedient kid:
- Single-threaded. 
- Synchronous. 
- No drama. 🎭

But then a wild question appeared:
> 🐉 How does Node.js multitask like a caffeinated octopus? ☕🐙

💥 Boom! Enter **LiBUV** — the undercover agent managing threads and async I/O in the background.

- While JavaScript chills, **𝗟𝗶𝗕𝗨𝗩** runs secret operations backstage.
- Node.js architecture makes sense now:  
  - **JavaScript** = Good boy (single-threaded, synchronous)
  - **Node.js** = Async wizard (powered by 𝗟𝗶𝗕𝗨𝗩)
